# Winfinity-AHK
Winfinity is a window manager for Windows, inspired by projects such as [10GUI](https://youtu.be/zWz1KbknIZk?t=146), [Andy Matuschak's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), and [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM)

What it does:
- All supported application windows take up full height of the screen, and do not overlap each other
- When a new window is opened, it is placed on the right edge of your screen. All other windows are pushed to the left to make room.
- When a window is closed, windows to the left of it are moved to the right to take up the revealed space.
- Pressing Windows+Enter while a window is focused moves it to the right edge.
